Mac File Managers
-----------------

Is there a good commander clone for Mac
I’m considering making my own clone. 


I have found some file managers inspired by Norton Commander , however they all seem to miss out on some of these essential things:


- TAB doesn’t jump between the left/right pane. Makes the commander pointless.
- Page Up/Down moves scrollview, but not the cursor. Making Page Up/Down pointless.
- Page Up/Down moves cursor, but to top/bottom row of scrollview, so that the cursor centering is lost, causing minor annoyance.
- Jumping to parent dir, doesn’t remember the cursor position, causing you to forget where you were before you followed a dir/link.
- Impossible to open a file with TextMate/Hexedit/Preview/etc. from the keyboard.
- Weak keyboard support, requires mouse for essential operations.
- Apple’s filesystem yields a 10 second timeout  sometimes causing the UI to hang and a spinning beachball is shown. There is no way to cancel/abort when this happens.
- TextMate partical search makes a huge difference when finding files. None of the file managers has it.
- Theming: monospaced fonts, colors.
- Too slow scrollspeed. Or varying scrollspeed, making scrolling really painful.
- Shows too little info about files, in the Inspector window.
- No QuickLook.
- No way to gain permission to edit files on your own computer, even though you are admin.. I miss “sudo” in this case.



Orthodox File Manager
---------------------

PROBLEM: not finished yet.
PROBLEM: ugly.
PROBLEM: no FTP.
PROBLEM: two Panes, but no multiple TAB.
PROBLEM: one commander window all the time.
PLANNED FEATURE: elevate permissions like “sudo” to gain access to ALL files.
PLANNED FEATURE: move/copy/delete many files.
PLANNED FEATURE: git/svn/rake integration
IDEA: navigation as in norton commander.
IDEA: popup menu with actions per file.
IDEA: quick look.
IDEA: killable discover process, so no beachball because of timeouts .
IDEA: partial search
IDEA: size-bars instead of file-sizes to make it easier to spot huge/small files, without carefully reading up on KB, MB, GB.
IDEA: info tabs at the bottom, that shows MIME type, and a lot of other info.



Captain FTP - very close to Total Commander
-------------------------------------------
http://captainftp.xdsnet.de/

At first this looked like a dual pane localhost <> FTP  client. However its possible to switch both panes to localhost. And its possible to create multiple TABS in each pane. Making it a real commander clone. Maybe the closest to Total Commander for Mac.

PROBLEM: page up/down is not moving the cursor. Otherwise navigation is REALLY good.
PROBLEM: too much focus on FTP. no way to easily open apps with the selected files, making unusable. too little focus on local navigation, interaction with files.
IDEA: each of the two panes, can have one or more TABS open.
IDEA: there can be multiple commander windows open simultaneous.
IDEA: file sharing.. allow other users to connect to this Captain FTP.

Midnight Commander

muCommander
-----------
http://www.mucommander.com/

PROBLEM: poor mac integration. Info for a file is minimal.
PROBLEM: page up/down destroys the otherwise excellent arrow up/down navigation. TAB key works perfect too.
PROBLEM: doesn’t feels mac’ish.
IDEA: built-in viewer... hit F3 to view.. and then ESC to get back. Really fast viewer.
IDEA: spacebar.. toggles selection and jumps to next file.. perfect.
IDEA: split horizontally option.
IDEA: ftp support.
OK: “copy” file dialog shows a chart of transferspeed. And it’s possible to limit the transfer rate!
OK: split/combine file



Forklift
--------
http://www.binarynights.com/

I first thought that ForkLift sucked a lot, because it appeared not to have Norton Commander keybindings/behavior at all. However in the preferences there was an option, so now impression is better.

PROBLEM: scrollspeed is slow. non responsive many places.
PROBLEM: pageup/pagedown doesn’t preserve the cursor position.
PROBLEM: spacebar selection, jumps to next item when the key repeat. This makes it very difficult to use spacebar selection. Feels better in muCommander when ALWAYS jumps!
PROBLEM: in Commander mode, the cursor is a dashed box, making it impossible to see where the cursor is located!
PROBLEM: no parentdir “..” in the filelist, making it impossible to quickly step in to a dir with Enter and step out hitting Enter again. Instead you have to hit Backspace, Fucking up quick navigation.
PROBLEM: search-field. I have no idea what it searches for, nothing is shown.
PROBLEM: you are punished if you hit the wrong keys, such as, ArrowLeft, ArrowRight. It simply FORGETS where it was.
PROBLEM: no keybindings for go to a bookmark.
OK: tab-key, backspace, home/end, enter-key works. F3=quicklook.
IDEA: looks good.
IDEA: internal terminal drawer can be popped out at the bottom.
IDEA: nice NSPathControl
IDEA: connect to... amazon S3, bluetooth device, ftp, sftp, webdav.
IDEA: gradient info box at the bottom looks nice. Too cluttered though.
IDEA: “show invisible items” colors the items gray, which looks great.
IDEA: good quicklook integration.



PathFinder - has by far most features
-------------------------------------
http://www.cocoatech.com/

PROBLEM: TAB between the 2 panes is NOT possible!

PROBLEM: scrollspeed is slow.

IDEA: option for making the scrollbar smaller.
IDEA: has  “modules” with iTunes, SVN, Hex editor, Preview.
IDEA: “Edit Image...” is a built-in editor for images!
IDEA: “Burn...” for cd burning.
IDEA: “Report” can make a verbose html document with filetype info.

OK: backspace works.
OK: enter on a folder works.
OK: copy big file and hit “cancel”.. provides you with a “continue” option to resume.
IDEA: “Access Denied” growl like notification, when you try access something you don’t have permission to. It fades away after 0.3 seconds, so its VERY nice.
IDEA: spacebar on a folder, makes it start counting the size of the folder.
