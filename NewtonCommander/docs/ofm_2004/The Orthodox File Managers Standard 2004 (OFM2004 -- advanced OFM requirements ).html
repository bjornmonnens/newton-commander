<h1>Orthodox File Managers Standard 2004 (OFM2004) -- advanced OFM requirements</h1>
<p>The Orthodox File Managers Standard is undated periodically (usually once in 
five years) to reflect progress in OFM implementations. </p>
<p>The Orthodox File Managers Standard 2004 specified 4 areas of compliance: basic, 
command line (including user and extension menu), viewer/editor, and VFS.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The compliance in OFM2004 is measured a way similar to TCP/IP addresses i.e. 
100.45.0.0 means that particular OFM has a score 100% on part 1 (basic compatibility), 
score 60% out&nbsp; on the part 2&nbsp; and zeroes on the part three and four of 
the standard (see below).&nbsp; In this case the average score would be 40% and 
it does not tell the whole truth as this implementation perfectly implement all 
basic features.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The score is determined separately for each section of the standard. Each section 
consists of&nbsp; subsections that&nbsp; specified measurable requirements that 
need to be met.&nbsp; Each subsection has a Weight that determine its weight in 
the total score. </p>
<p><strong>Important notes: </strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>The Orthodox File Managers Standard is&nbsp; undated periodically (usually 
	once a year) to reflect progress in OFM implementations </li>
	<li>50% or better compliance with the parts 1-4of the standard are required 
	for the implementation to be considered an implementation conformant with&nbsp; 
	the OFM2004.</li>
	<li>The Orthodox File Managers Standard 2004 does not require key assignments 
	to be exactly the sane as in the standard as long as there is a possibility 
	to change them.&nbsp; The specified in the standard key bindings are<i> recommended.</i> 
	If semantically the feature implemented in accordance with OFM doctrine, but 
	there is no key remapping feature and the OFM use different hot-key, then the 
	compliance score for the feature is multiplied by 0.66. </li>
	<li>If feature can be implemented using existing commands (for example unpacking 
	the archive into the directory with the same name as the name of the archive 
	can be implemented via user menu) than it is assigned the low Weight (usually 
	1). </li>
	<li>The structure of main menu is not defined in the test.</li>
	<li>The capability to connect with a different computer via serial line is considered 
	obsolete and not included in the test. </li>
	<li>All <em>Alt </em>keys can be replaced with <em>Ctrl-Alt </em>keys in Windows 
	GOFM implementations. </li>
</ul>
<p>The OFM2004 standard consists of 3 parts </p>
<p>Part 1: <b><a href="#Basic_comapitibility">Basic Compatibility </a></b></p>
<p>Part 2: <b><a href="#Shell Execution compatibility">Shell Execution compatibility</a></b> 
( Command Line, user menu and extension menu)</p>
<p>Part 3:<b> <a href="#Built-in Editor and Viewer">Built-in Editor and Viewer
</a>&nbsp;(</b>Built-in Editor is optional for GUI based implementations)</p>
<p>Part 4: <b><a href="#VFS_comaptibility">Virtual file systems support compatibility</a></b></p>
<p>Generally for the inclusion into one of the sections of the standard the feature 
needs to be present either in MC (as a leading Unix-based implementation), FAR or 
NCW 2.0 or be consistently implemented in at least two other major OFM implementations 
(for example XTree virtual file system is consistently implemented in Total Commander 
and Northern Captain with the hotkey binding Ctrl-B) and have stable semantics.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Hotkey assignments listed below can be different from recommended, if key remapping 
capability is implemented in a particular OFM, otherwise 0.66 coefficient is used 
if semantically operation in implemented correctly. For simplicity all numbered 
requirements have an equal weight. </p>
<p>All features are assigned <i>weight </i>on the scale 1-3. It is used in calculation 
of compliance with the standard.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Weight 3</b> is assigned to features that are considered <b><i>indispensable</i></b>; 
	they proved their usefulness and are frequently used by power users in existing 
	implementations; for part one such features constitute the cornerstone of the 
	&quot;look and feel&quot; of OFMs; developers should think twice before omitting them.&nbsp;
	</li>
	<li><b>Weight 2 </b>is assigned to features that are <b><i>essential and field 
	proven but the absence of which will not noticeably slow down advanced users
	</i></b>either because there are alternative ways to achieve similar effects 
	or the features are used not that often </li>
	<li><b>Weight 1</b> is assigned to those features that, although essential,
	<i><b>can be fully implemented using existing commands</b></i> (for example 
	unpacking the archive into the directory with the same name as the name of the 
	archive can be implemented via user menu). </li>
</ul>
<p>If the weight is not stated it should be assumed to be 3</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Basic_comapitibility">Part 1. Basic compatibility</a></h2>
<ol>
	<li><b>Panel navigation and basic hot keys compatibility:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>The <b>Tab</b> key should change active panel to passive and passive 
		to active </li>
		<li><b>Ctrl-\ </b>key should move to the root of the drive ( mandatory only 
		for DOS/Windows implementations; in Unix is can be home of the current user 
		(Cd ~) or the mount point of the current file system)</li>
		<li><b>Ctrl-PgDn</b> and <b>Ctrl-PgUp </b>&nbsp;move to the upper (current 
		subdirectory) and lower level (parent i.e. CD ..) directories; in Unix left 
		and right arrows can be used instead (Lynx style navigation in MC), but 
		they are more error prone.&nbsp; The importance of this feature is that 
		it permit exit from several level of directories (traversing tree up) without 
		using tree view<b> </b>(Weight 3)</li>
		<li><b>Alt-PgDn</b>&nbsp; should open the directory under the cursor (or 
		archive under the cursor) directory&nbsp; on the passive panel, <b>Alt-PgUp</b> 
		should show the parent directory on the passive panel&nbsp;
		<font color="#008000"><b>(new in OFM2004)&nbsp; </b></font></li>
		<li><b>Ctrl-R</b> -- should reread the directory;</li>
		<li><b>Ctrl-U </b>-- should swap panels;</li>
		<li><b>Alt-F1</b> and <b>Alt-F2</b><i> </i>(<b>Ctrl_Alt-F1/F2</b> is recommended 
		for Windows) should produce the list of logical disks for left and right 
		panels (not applicable for UNIX implementations. For Unix-based implementation 
		the list of directory favorites or mount points can be produced.);</li>
		<li><b>Ctrl-Q </b>should switch to quick view;<i> (only for classic implementations; 
		n/a for GOFM)</i></li>
		<li><b>Ctrl-L </b>should switch to the information panel.&nbsp; Information 
		panel should provide at least statistics about the current directory and 
		current drive. If directory description (file dirinfo) is available it should 
		be displayed as well (Compatibility with dirinfo descriptions is optional 
		for UNIX-based implementations.)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Compatibility of&nbsp; F1..F8 operations:</b> </li>
	<ul>
		<li><b>F1</b> -- should not only invoke hypertext help, it should invoke

		should be context sensitive: if some dialog is opened the help should be 
		about this particular dialog, not the general help tree. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li><b>F2 </b>-- user menu or equivalent (start menu). Should provide the 
		possibility to run user shell scripts with substitution of macro variables 
		from the panels. Each item of the menu should be activated by its own letter 
		(hotkey). Format of the macro variable is not defined in this standard but 
		following Midnight Commander conventions is recommended.&nbsp; See part 
		2.2 for specification of the user menu semantic. <br>
&nbsp;</li>

			specify this external viewer and editor</li>
			<li><b>Optional: Additional option in Options menu </b>to specify invocation 
			of built-in viewer and editor in the panel mode instead of full screen 
			mode. At this mode all command line insertion capabilities should be

			opposite panel (just directories, no files)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li><b>F8</b> should delete current or selected files or directory subtree. 
		It should work if applied to the directory with non-empty subdirectories. 
		In case the group is selected the operation is performed on each member 
		of the group. <b>Shift-F8</b> (unlink) or similar combination should work 
		only there are still multiple link hard link to a particular file/directory.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Panel Tree View and Directory Search panel compatibility:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Panel resizing</b><ul>
			<li>Panel should be able to shrink in vertical direction. In this case 
			&quot;shell area&quot; should enlarge accordingly</li>
			<li>User should be able to extend of shrink size of left column (possibly 
			by moving the column divider)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>Directory tree semantic.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>In OFMs there should be 
		two distinct tree panels:<ul>
			<li><b><i>A regular tree panel.</i></b> Activated by <b>Ctrl-T</b>. 
			In this case tree replaces the <i><b>passive panel</b></i> Tree panel 
			should work in three modes:
			<ul>
				<li><i>The default mode</i>: The cursor can be moved independently 
				and does not affect the opposite panel. Pressing Enter opens the 
				directory under the cursor in the opposite panel. Copy and Move 
				operations from the opposite panel are targeted to the current directory 
				on the tree. Quick view mode (<i>&quot;dive into the directory mode&quot;)</i> 
				should be available via hotkey Ctrl-Q. Quick search mode should 
				be available via Alt - key combination. </li>
				<li><i>Quick view mode</i> (<i>&quot;dive into the directory mode&quot;) S</i>witchable 
				with Ctrl-Q. This mode is similar to the behavior of Windows Explorer 
				movement of the cursor opens the directory under the cursor in the 
				opposite window.&nbsp; Mostly used for quick traversing of the directory 
				tree in a mode similar to quick view with directories opening as 
				we move the cursor (quick diving into subdirectories). Quick search 
				should be available. </li>
				<li><i>Information mode</i> (Ctrl-L). Similar to quick view mode. 
				But in this case the movement of the cursor on the tree panel opens 
				not a listing of files in the directory but the information window 
				should be shown that calculated statistics for the directory (number 
				of the files, total size, number of subfolders, attributes, owners, 
				etc).&nbsp; </li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b><i>The directory search panel. </i></b>Activated by<b><i> </i>
			Alt-F10</b>. Also should be present as an option in the top menu as 
			Command/Find folder in Far, Command/Directory tree in mc, ). This panel 
			should instantly provide a quick search window. It should be also accessible 
			from copy/move dialogs&nbsp; (via F10) as it is often used not only 
			for the &quot;directory completion&quot; and traversing of the tree, but also 
			for the quick selection of the target directory for copy/move operations</li>
			<li>Both panels should support expansion/collapse branches (Standard 
			hotkeys are currently undefined; Ctrl-+/Ctrl- hotkeys are recommended)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</li>
	<li><b>Tree Panel Hotkeys Compatibility </b>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Tree View panel </b>
		<ol>
			<li>In tree panel usual keys can be using for moving the directories 
			to the opposite panel. </li>
			<li>Regular copy/move keys should also work from the regular panel if 
			tree panel is the target. In this case the target directory is the current 
			directory on the tree panel. </li>
			<li>Delete operation should work on tree panel. </li>
			<li>Movement of the cursor on the panel with tree representation should 
			not lead to change of the directory on the current panel unless Ctrl-Q 
			was additionally pressed (quick mode activated).&nbsp; </li>
			<li><b>Ctrl-enter </b>should paste the current directory in the command 
			line</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li><b>Quick search in Tree View panel: </b>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Ctrl-Q</b> on tree panel should switch the panel into &quot;quick 
			search mode&quot; like normal panel. In this mode changing the directory 
			on the active panel should lead to display of the content of this directory 
			on the passive panel. In quick search mode <b>Ctrl-Enter</b> should&nbsp; 
			jump to the next directory with the same prefix (If no prefix is specified 
			it find the next directory with the same name, if any)&nbsp; In normal 
			mode it should paste the current directory into the command line.
			</li>
			<li>Ctrl-Enter should&nbsp; jump to the next directory with the same 
			prefix. If there is no text in the quick search window quick search 
			mode should find the next directory with the same name, if any. </li>
			<li>Rescanning of the directory tree should be available via Ctrl-R 
			and/or F2. Pressing Alt-F10 should <em>not</em> produce rescanning of 
			the disk without reason. </li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li><b>Both panels </b>
		<ol>
			<li>Backspace should move to the previous level of the directory tree.
			</li>
			<li><b>Gray+</b> (or spacebar), <b>Gray-</b> (backspace) should move 
			up and down the tree to the next branch on the same level&nbsp; (left 
			arrow and right arrow can be used in Unix). </li>
			<li>Quick search should be activated for Directory Search panel on invocation 
			. </li>
			<li><b>Ctrl-PgUp/Ctrl-PgDn</b> should work as usual on both Tree panel 
			and Directory search panel. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Selection/deselection compatibility:</b></li>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Ins</b> should select a single file (cursor may move one line down 
		if such option is set);</li>
		<li><b>Gray+</b> and <b>Gray- </b>should select and deselect file using 
		a regular expression or mask;</li>
		<li><b>Gray *</b> should invert the selection;</li>
		<li>Special keys (<b>Ctrl-Gray+</b> and <b>Ctrl-Gray- </b>are recommended) 
		for selecting deselecting all files regardless of current selection;</li>
		<li>Selection and deselection operations should be persistent (second selection 
		operation should add to existing selection, deselection should remove some 
		or all files). </li>
		<li>Restore Selection operation (no standard key exist). It should restore 
		highlighting of files selected for last copying operation. </li>
		<li>UNIX-style regular expressions should be supported&nbsp; in selections 
		(expression *a*.* should select files like my_bak.tmp and my_bat.txt, not 
		all files) </li>
		<li>Ability to select all file with the extension equal to the extension 
		of the current file or the last part of the filename in UNIX (<b>Ctrl-Enter</b> 
		for the extension).</li>
		<li>Selections history should be available with the ability to open history 
		with <b>Ctrl</b>-<b>ArrowDn</b>, or browse it in the input line ( C-shell 
		style) with <b>ArrowUp</b> and <b>ArrowDn</b> keys.</li>
		<li>Option &quot;Process multiple names&quot; should be provided and if activated 
		should permit specified several regular expressions (or DOS masks) separated 
		with &quot;;&quot; (semicolon), for example<blockquote>
			<pre><font color="#0000FF">*.html; *.htm</font></pre>
		</blockquote>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Quick view compatibility:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>The viewer should be invokes according to the extension menu (file association 
		list) information. </li>
		<li>For archive content of the information files should be shown (list of 
		information files should be customizable, but default should include&nbsp; 
		File_id.diz, read.me, readme.1st). In case no description is available the 
		content of the archive should be should.</li>
		<li>Pressing F3 or Alt-F3 in quick view should lead to switching to regular 
		(wide screen ) view. </li>
		<li>Pressing F4 should invoke the editor in the panel (no full screen)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Quick search compatibility:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>Alt-<em>letter</em> (or Ctrl-Alt for GUI-based versions) quick search 
		option should be available for both regular and tree views of the panel.
		</li>
		<li>Ctrl-Enter during quick search should move to the next item with given 
		initial letters.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>FindFile(Ctrl-F7) compatibility</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Reversible implementation of at least View ( F3 and edit (F4)&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		-- after exiting user return to the search panel without researching; irreversible 
		implementation of Jump (Enter). <br>
		Please note that search can be used as a poor man command completion in 
		the current directory: it&#39;s very convenient for files with long names and 
		for search operation and essentially bridges search operation and wide (double-width) 
		panel representation.</li>
		<li>The ability to search by content (regular expression like in Grep)
		<i>(Weight 3)<b> </b></i></li>
		<li>The ability to search by timestamp range and age of the file <i>(Weight

		<li>Search history <i>(Weight 3)<b> </b></i></li>
		<li>Panelize option or availability of all other file operations directly 
		from the search panel (optional if Script-based VFS is implemented as in 
		MC); Refresh (Ctrl-R) should work for panelized view. </li>
		<li>Search from the root and search from the current directory options</li>
		<li>The possibility of a quick selection of the start directory using tree 
		search panel (F10)</li>
		<li>Search in archives<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Sorting directories compatibility:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>The ability to view files (and optionally directories, but directories 
		should generally precede files) sorted by name, time, size, and unsorted 
		order (minimum is &quot;NETSU&quot; (sorting by <b>N</b>ame, <b>E</b>xtension, modification<b> 
		T</b>ime, <b>S</b>ize, and <b>U</b>nsorted). The ability to sort by creation 
		time, access time and descriptions is optional.&nbsp;&nbsp; For Unix, the 
		ability to sort by permissions, owner and group is recommended (&quot;NETSUPOG&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</li>
		<li>The hotkey assignment for sorting is optional.&nbsp; If the hotkey is 
		defined its action should correspond to the <b>F9-(LR)-S</b> sequence for 
		the current panel and display the same menu so that the proper order can 
		be selected with the second key from the menu ( <b>Ctrl-F12 (FAR)</b> is 
		recommended).&nbsp; In addition, &quot;old-style&quot; hotkeys <b>Ctrl-F3</b>, <b>
		Ctrl-F4</b>, <b>Ctrl-F5</b>, <b>Ctrl-F6</b> and <b>Ctrl-F7</b> can be provided&nbsp; 
		for sorting by name, extension, modification time, size and unsorted, correspondingly

		<li>The ability to reverse the sorting order by using the same hotkey again 
		should be provided. </li>
		<li>If mouse is supported, then mouse click on any header (name, size, time, 
		etc) in the panel view should change the sorting order for this attribute. 
		Second mouse click on the same button reverses the sorting order (Windows 
		Commander 3.03; NCW 1.0); </li>
		<li>Sorting Groups should be available, for example (htm|html|shtml) as 
		one group.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>User menu script invocation compatibility (GUI implementations can provide 
	alternative methods to run custom scripts with parameters taken from the panel):</b>

		<li>File attribute command (no hot key specified, should be available via 
		menu) should permit changing of attributes and file stamps of a&nbsp; single 
		file or group of files, or subtree (if applied to the directory) as well 
		as ownership (in Unix);</li>
		<li>File case conversion command should permit changing of the case of the

	<li><b>Dialog box extensions:</b> </li>
	<ul>
		<li>Support of regular expressions everywhere were applicable (MC, FAR). 
		Unix RegEx notation should be used. </li>
		<li><em>Ctrl-Enter</em>, <em>Ctrl-[ </em>and <em>Ctrl-]</em> keystrokes 
		pressed in input lines of dialog boxes make the same actions as in the command 
		line (VC)</li>
		<li>Mouse click on current file in the panel information line (bottom line 
		of the panel) should input file extension to the opened dialog box, for 
		example the selection list or copy dialog box&nbsp; (VC).</li>
		<li>Support of clipboard and standard set of editing operation in dialog 
		boxes.<em> Ctrl-X/C/V </em>or equivalents<em> (Shift-Del, Ctrl-Del and Ctrl-Ins)

		<li>The command line at the bottom of the screen actually is a minimized 
		to one line shell windows and there should be at least two capabilities 
		to expand them</li>
		<li>Ctrl-O should&nbsp; maximize shell screen to the whole terminal window 
		(hide panels). In the resulting screen standard shell functionality should 
		be present as if this is a telnet session to localhost. For example, if 
		the shell for a particular OS provides browsing of shell history with arrow 
		keys this should work.&nbsp; (for COFMs only, GOFMs can extend active panel 
		to the full screen, if they do not support OS shell screen view);</li>
		<li>Ctrl-F1/Ctrl-F2 should provide a view of the shell screen with overlaid 
		one panel. If this panel contains minimized editor it should remain functional.
		</li>
		<li>There should be either the ability to expand/shrink shell screen one 
		line at a time (like in Far) or provide one step expansion to half screen 
		(like in classic NC implementation since NC 2.0) with a hotkey. <br>
&nbsp;</li>

		<li>Cursor movement keys should work like in OS shell when panels are hidden
		</li>
		<li>Command history&nbsp; availability:<ol>
			<li>Should be available&nbsp; both via hotkey (<b>Alt-F8</b>)&nbsp; 
			and C-shell-style browsing mode.&nbsp; </li>
			<li>In C-shell style browsing mode&nbsp; the retrieval of a command 
			from the history into the command line should be possible with the hotkeys, 
			for example (for example, <b>Alt-E, Alt-X </b>like in NC5). </li>
			<li>The possibility of&nbsp; sorting command history in history window 
			and eliminating duplicates. </li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Command completion feature: Alt-Tab<i> or </i><b>Ctrl-End</b> at the 
		end of the command line complete the command starting with these symbols 
		from the command history. In case several variant of completion are possible 
		they should either displayed or it should be possible to press <b>Ctrl-End</b> 
		several times to find the next command in the history that has the same 
		prefix;</li>
		<li>Change of the current directory via command or script execution changes 
		the directory on the active panel;</li>
		<li>The ability to execute arbitrary command or script for selected files 
		(DN, VC, FAR, WinCmd) ;<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>The &quot;special paste&quot; operation compatibility.</b> The following operation 
	should be supported for command line (minimized shell window) mode:
	<ol>
		<li>Inserting current path from left and right panels (<b>Ctrl-[ </b>and
		<b>Ctrl-]</b>) </li>
		<li>Inserting the&nbsp; current file <b>Ctrl-Enter</b>&nbsp; (if one or 
		several files are selected they should be inserted into the command line 
		instead of the current) </li>
		<li>Inserting the current file with the full path <b>Ctrl-Shift-Enter</b></li>

			<li>Inserting the current file from the passive panel</li>
			<li>Inserting the&nbsp; current file with abs path from the passive 
			panel<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>User menu (usually bound to F2)</b>. Also called Start menu. Should provide 
	the possibility to run user shell scripts with substitution of macro variables 
	that represent information extracted prom active or passive panel.&nbsp; The 
	menu may contain submenus. Each item of the menu should be activated by its 
	own letter (hotkey). <br>
&nbsp;<ol>
		<li>You can create three types of user menu: global (or main), user-based 
		and directory based.
		<ol>
			<li>The main user menu is called if no local menu for the current folder 
			is available. </li>
			<li>User is called if user defined its own menu in his home directory</li>
			<li>The local menu may be placed in any folder. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>You may switch between the main menu and the user menu by pressing Shift-F2 
		instead of F2. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>If local (directory-based)&nbsp; menu is present then it overrides both 
		user menu and main menu<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Format of the macro variable is not defined in this standard but following 
		Midnight Commander conventions is recommended.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>To execute a user menu command, select it with cursor keys and press 
		Enter.<br>
		You may also press the hot key assigned to the required menu item. It is 
		possible to use digits, letters and function keys (F1..F12) as hot keys 
		in user menu. If F1 or F4 is used, its original function in user menu is 
		overridden. However, you still may use Shift-F4 to edit the menu.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>User should be able to edit user menu using regular built-in editor.
		<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Two styles of macro substitution symbols are acceptable (MC-style or 
		NC-style). MC style is recommended and NC style is deprecated.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<ol>
			<li><b>The MC-style naming system for macro substitution symbols for 
			active panel</b> (see nelow the set for passive panel) <br>
&nbsp;<ul>
				<li>&quot;%f&quot; The current file name.</li>
				<li>&quot;%F&quot; The current file in the unselected panel.</li>
				<li>&quot;%d&quot; The current directory name.</li>
				<li>&quot;%D&quot; The directory name of the unselected panel.</li>
				<li>&quot;%t&quot; The currently tagged files.</li>
				<li>&quot;%T&quot; The tagged files in the unselected panel.</li>
				<li>&quot;%u&quot; and &quot;%U&quot; Similar to the %t and %T macros, but after the 
				operation all selected files are untagged. That means that this 
				macro can be used only once per menu entry (or extension entry), 
				because on the second and subsequent invocations there will be no 
				tagged files.</li>
				<li>&quot;%s&quot; and &quot;%S&quot;&nbsp; The tagged files if there are any. Otherwise 
				the current file.</li>
				<li>&quot;%cd&quot; This is a special macro that is used to change the current 
				directory to the directory specified in front of it. This is used 
				primarily as an interface to the VFS.</li>
				<li>&quot;%view&quot;&nbsp; the invocation of the internal viewer. An argument 
				to force the viewer in a particular mode can be passed:<em> ASCII
				</em>to force the viewer into ASCII mode; <em>hex</em> to force 
				the viewer into hex mode; <br>
				</li>
				<li>&quot;%%&quot; The % character</li>
				<li>&quot;%{some text}&quot; Popup an input box and prompts for the substitution.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				The user should be able to cancel input ( ESC or F10 recommended).
				<br>
&nbsp;</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>There should also be a special prefix of suffix that turns macro 
			symbols for active panel to macro symbols to passive panel, if applicable, 
			for example %f is the current file name on active panel but %-f is the 
			current name on the passive panel. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
			<li><b>NC-style</b> <b>naming system for macro substitution symbols 
			in OFMs</b> (not recommended for Unix implementations, they should use 
			mc-style symbols, see above). At least the following macro symbols should 
			be defined:<br>
			<br>
&nbsp; !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current 
			file name without extension<br>
&nbsp; !.!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current file name 
			with extension<br>
&nbsp; ^!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current filename 
			of the passive panel without extension<br>
&nbsp; ^!.!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current filename of the 
			passive panel <br>
&nbsp; !&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List of names of selected files<br>
&nbsp; !:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current drive<br>
&nbsp; !\&nbsp; or !/&nbsp;&nbsp; The current path<br>
			<br>
			Some prefix or suffix (for example ^) can be used to define the same 
			macros for the passive panel to refer to the passive panel. <br>
			<br>
			NC style is deprecated and should be avoided in new implementations 
			of OFMs<br>
&nbsp;</li>

		</li>
		<li>Reasonable subset of file operations implemented:&nbsp; </li>
		<ul>
			<li>View, quick view&nbsp; and edit should be supported;</li>
			<li>Files can be selected, deselected as in regular folder;</li>
			<li>File or groups can copied (copying to regular folder result in extraction; 
			copying to archived folder results in compression; copied, moved, viewed

			<li>Files can be deleted and renamed;</li>
			<li>Support of View (including &quot;Quick View&quot; and Edit operations)</li>
			<li>Support of directory based operations with archive as a target (compressing 
			directory with all subdirectories to the archive) </li>
			<li>Support of compare directories operation between archive and regular 
			folder and between two archives.</li>
			<li>Add to archive operation on the directory should create archive 
			of that directory and optionally delete the directory and all files 
			in it.</li>
			<li>Complete archive extraction to the directory operation on the archive 
			should create directory with the name of the archive by default and 
			un-archive all files into this directory. </li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Support of at least ZIP, GZIP, TAR, ARJ, RAR and LHA;</li>
		<li>If both panels are viewing archives, file operation like copy and move 
		should be possible.</li>
		<li>Ability to view self-extracting archives via Ctrl-PgDn;</li>
		<li>Support of additional commands (integrity check, repair, etc.) via special 
		menu item (for example Shift-F3);<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Search VFS (optional if Script VFS is implemented)</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Panelize command in the search mode creates a virtual panel with the 
		files that satisfies the search criteria. </li>
		<li>Ability to hide full path in order to see duplicates and other anomalies.
		</li>
		<li>The ability to perform operations with a single file on Search VFS as 
		a target </li>
		<li>Ability to use panel filters with the virtual search panel. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Xtree VFS&nbsp; (also called &quot;flat&quot; VFS, recommended key assignment Ctrl-B)</b><br>
	The ability to view all files in the subtree (current directory and all its 
	subdirectories) as a double-width panel (like in Xtree) with all file operations 
	available. This is a very important feature for system administration.&nbsp; 
	Filters on subtree should be available (Total Commander, Northern Capitan)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Script VFS -- the ability run an arbitrary script that produce a list 
	of names of files and view the result in the panel (MC <em>panelize</em> command).</b>
	<ul>
		<li>All reasonable operations that use this panel as a source should be 
		allowed. </li>
		<li>Only a single file can be used as a target.</li>
		<li>Refresh operation should lead to another invocation of the script<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Briefcase VFS (panelizing history of visited directories and browsed 
	files) </b>
	<ul>
		<li>History of browsed files<ul>
			<li>Automatic&nbsp; addition of links to all recently changed files 
			to the briefcase virtual directory;</li>
			<li>Automatic deletion of the files from the briefcase that are more 
			than N days old;</li>
			<li>Ability manually add files to the briefcase folder;</li>
			<li>Ability to use a briefcase as a virtual source panel for all relevant 
			file and selection based operations;</li>
			<li>Ability to discard the content of a briefcase.</li>
			<li>Only single file in the briefcase can be used as a target<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><b>History of visited directories VFS </b>(it can be a very limited 
		VFS -- essentially FAR functionality is enough)</li> </li>
	</ul>
	<blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<ul>
				<li>The ability to view the history of visited directories it in 
				a virtual panel and be able to perform reasonable subset of operations 
				on this list;</li>
				<li>Hotkeys&nbsp; and/or buttons to navigate history (like back 
				and forward buttons in Netscape);</li>
				<li>Ability to add directories from the favorite list to history</li>
				<li>Ability to search history;</li>
