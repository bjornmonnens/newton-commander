It's a commander. You already know how to use it. If you have experience with another commander
then you shouldn't have difficulties switching to this commander. At least thats what should
be the benefit of this type of program, however on Mac there are some really strange commanders.
They may look like commanders, but the keyboard bindings are not like you would expect them to.

Path Finder .......... TAB doesn't switch between the panels. 
Fork Lift ............ TAB doesn't switch between the panels. 
Transmit ............. TAB doesn't switch between the panels. 
muCommander .......... TAB works as you would expect it to.
Midnight Commander ... TAB works as you would expect it to.

I'm surprised to see that most important keybinding (TAB) is useless in the most popular commanders
on Mac. When I first saw it I thought, if were to make a commander then this would be the first
thing I would aim for getting working. Later when I started out coding Newton Commander, TAB was
indeed the first thing I got working.
