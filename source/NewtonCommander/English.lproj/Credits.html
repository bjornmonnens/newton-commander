<dt>History</dt>
<dd>
I have long been needing a file manager suitable for my programming activities, so in 2009 I began working on Newton Commander.
The name Newton Commander is on purpose very close to the name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Commander">Norton Commander</a>, which is the MSDOS file manager that started it all.
It's a tribute to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Isaac Newton</a> which is one of the greates scientist that have ever lived.
